# Hi, I'm Navin

**Building software for nearly two decades. Currently rethinking engineering workflows through AI.**

---

I've built distributed systems, APIs, and document platforms that power millions of workflows. These days I'm deep into AI-assisted engineering, using tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot not just to write code faster but to rethink how I approach architecture, testing, and shipping.

### What I work on

I build and maintain microservices and platform APIs at Workday, working closely with product and design to connect technical decisions to business outcomes. My day-to-day is systems architecture — designing for reliability, observability, and scale across event-driven services — while leading teams that ship across those boundaries. I've been focused lately on integrating AI into real development workflows: prompt design, quality evaluation, and figuring out where these tools actually help vs. where they get in the way.

### What I know well

**Core expertise**
`Software architecture & distributed systems` · `Microservices & event-driven design` · `Observability & reliability` · `API & platform design`

**Current focus**
`AI-augmented development workflows` · `Prompt engineering & quality guardrails` · `Cross-functional delivery with Product & Design`

**Tools & tech**
`Python` · `Kubernetes` · `Java` · `Spring Boot` · `React Native`

### Currently exploring

AI as a thinking partner in engineering — how to design better prompts, build quality guardrails, and integrate these tools into team workflows without losing the craft. Also experimenting with voice interfaces, document intelligence, and ways to bridge technical and product thinking.

### Outside of work

Music production, visual art, writing about tech and life. San Francisco Bay Area.

This is my personal GitHub — side projects, hobby builds, and experiments across mobile, web, data, and tooling. Nothing here is work; it's where I tinker and ship for fun. For a curated overview, see **[navinvarma.github.io](https://navinvarma.github.io/)**.
