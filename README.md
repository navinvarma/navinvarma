## Hi, I'm Navin

I've spent nearly two decades building software — distributed systems, APIs, document platforms that power millions of workflows. These days I'm deep into AI-assisted engineering, using tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot not just to write code faster but to rethink how I approach architecture, testing, and shipping.

### What I work on

I build and maintain microservices and platform APIs at Workday, working closely with product and design to connect technical decisions to business outcomes. My day-to-day is systems architecture — designing for reliability, observability, and scale across event-driven services — while leading teams that ship across those boundaries. I've been focused lately on integrating AI into real development workflows: prompt design, quality evaluation, and figuring out where these tools actually help vs. where they get in the way.

### What I know well

`Software architecture & distributed systems` · `Microservices & event-driven design` · `Observability & reliability` · `AI-augmented development workflows` · `Prompt engineering & quality guardrails` · `API & platform design` · `Cross-functional delivery with Product & Design` ·  `Python` · `Kubernetes` · `Java` · `Spring Boot` · `React Native`

### Outside of work

Music production, visual art, writing about tech and life. San Francisco Bay Area.

This is my personal GitHub — side projects, hobby builds, and experiments across mobile, web, data, and tooling. Nothing here is work; it's where I tinker and ship for fun. For a curated overview, see **[navinvarma.github.io](https://navinvarma.github.io/)**.
